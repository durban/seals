# Notes for development

Unorganized notes which may be useful during development.

## Release process

1. Start a fresh `sbt` session
1. `validate`
1. `release` (requires Sonatype credentials)
1. Verify the 2 new commits and 1 new tag in Git
1. `sonatypeClose`
1. `sonatypePromote`
1. Push the new commits
1. Push the new tag (e.g., `git push --tags`)

### Releasing a `SNAPSHOT` version

(This is really only useful for testing the release process itself.)

1. Start a fresh `sbt` session
1. `validate`
1. `release` (specify a `SNAPSHOT` version when asked, e.g., `0.1.0-SNAPSHOT`;
   requires Sonatype credentials)
1. Delete the automatically created Git tag, e.g., `git tag --delete v0.1.0-SNAPSHOT`

## Signing Git commits and tags

There are several tutorials available on signing
in Git (and using it on GitHub), for example
[this one](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Signing-Your-Work)
and [this one](https://help.github.com/categories/gpg/).

Here is a quick outline of the steps (if you're already
familiar with [GPG](https://www.gnupg.org) and Git,
this might be enough):

- the key you want to use must be in your GPG keyring
- note your 64-bit key ID with `gpg2 --list-keys --keyid-format long`
- configure Git to use the desired key for signing:
  `git config --global user.signingkey <your key ID>`
- you can tell Git to use GPG v2 with `git config --global gpg.program gpg2`
- make sure that signing commits is the default:
  `git config --global commit.gpgsign true` (you can omit the `--global`
  to only sign by default the commits of the current repository)
- make sure that signing annotated tags is the default:
  `git config --global tag.forcesignannotated true`

## GnuPG configuration

Useful config options for GPG v2 (put them into `~/.gnupg/gpg.conf`):

- `keyid-format long`: display the long (64-bit) key ID by default
- `with-fingerprint`: display the full key fingerprint by default
- `no-comments`: don't put comments into the `.asc` output
- `no-emit-version`: don't write the GPG version number into the `.asc` output

## SSH authentication with GPG

- export the authentication public key in SSH format with `gpg2 --export-ssh-key <key ID>`
- add it to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` / GitHub / etc.
- enable `gpg-agent`: add `use-agent` to `~/.gnupg/gpg.conf`
- enable the SSH support of `gpg-agent`: add `enable-ssh-support` to `~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf`
- (reboot or at least restart X)
- make sure that `gpg-agent` is the running SSH agent:
    - the output of `echo $SSH_AUTH_SOCK` should contain the substring `gpg-agent`
    - if it doesn't, other possible agents may need to be disabled:
        - X11 default ssh-agent (disable with removing `use-ssh-agent` from `/etc/X11/Xsession.options`)
        - GNOME Keyring agent (?)
- the output of `ssh-add -l` should contain the auth key
  (if it's on a smartcard, only when the card is inserted)
    - `gpg-connect-agent updatestartuptty /bye`

## Using Eclipse

See [this workaround](https://gist.github.com/durban/621cf5becd38b3dcbf3d3a0d4464b46d).
